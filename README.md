Wine-quality-prediction-using-linear-regression
Overview the aims to predict the quality of wines based on various attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar, and more. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and it contains information about red wines.

data: This directory contains the dataset file, typically named winequality.csv, used for training and testing the model.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, and model development.

models:Tthe linear regression model is trained, it is saved in this directory for future use.

Data Preprocessing: Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to explore and preprocess the data. This may include handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2).

Results The model's performance and evaluation results are documented in the Jupyter notebooks within the notebooks directory. You can find detailed analysis and visualizations of the predictions.
